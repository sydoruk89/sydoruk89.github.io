        <p class="description">Shelter and rescue animals are in need of a second chance. They are lost, given up or abandoned. They are unwanted and helpless. You give them a new life in a loving home and at the same time, you make room at the shelter for another pet in need of a second chance.
                When you buy a pet, you not only deny a homeless pet a home, you are supporting an industry that thrives on short-changing the welfare of animals. Puppy and kitten mills (which sell to pet stores) are in business to make a profit, so they churn out puppies and kittens as fast as they can. These animals are often in ill health and have problems like poor socialization skills due to lack of human companionship and genetic defects due to inbreeding. Adopting a shelter or rescue animal means you donâ€™t support such cruel practices.</p>
